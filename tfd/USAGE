This instructions assume both DECAF and TFD are properly installed, 
otherwise check INSTALL.

How to (quickly) collect a trace using TFD: 

  0. Start DECAF (see INSTALL)

  1. Load TFD plugin
  (qemu) load_plugin TFD_PATH/tfd.so

  2. Identify the PID of the process to trace. 
     To list all running processes:
       a) in a Windows image: (qemu) guest_ps
       b) in a Linux image: (qemu) linux_ps

     If you are not able to list the running processes it means you have
     a problem with DECAF's OS introspection module 
     (i.e., VMI or the guest kernel module).
     This is a DECAF (rather than TFD) issue, so check the 
     DECAF forum for information.

  3. Start tracing the victim process.
  (qemu) trace <pid_of_victim_process> <trace_filename>

  4. After the experiment, stop tracing and collect the trace.
  (qemu) trace_stop
  (In addition to the trace file I recommend keeping the guest.log file that 
   DECAF places in the startup directory)


Tracing a process from the start
================================
If you want to trace a process from the start, then the PID is unknown. 
To trace, then replace steps 2. and 3. above with:

  2. (qemu) tc_modname <process_name>
     This is an optional command to prevent writing to the trace until 
     the first instruction in the main module of the process executes, 
     i.e., the trace does not contain the process creation. 
     You can skip this step if you want to include process creation in
     the trace.

  3. (qemu) tracebyname <process_name> <trace_filename>
     This instructs TFD to start tracing when the given process starts

For example: 
  (qemu) tc_modname named.exe
  (qemu) tracebyname named.exe "/tmp/tmp.trace"

Then, start the process
